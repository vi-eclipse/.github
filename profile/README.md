# Eclipse Development at Vector Informatik GmbH 

This organization is an umbrella for backlog management for issues (bugs and features) of Eclipse projects adressed by Vector Informatik GmbH.


## Contents

Currently, the development is focused on the [Eclipse Platform](https://github.com/eclipse-platform) and [Eclipse JDT](https://github.com/eclipse-jdt), being the basis for Eclipse RCP applications and the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipseide.org/).

Backlogs are managed in GitHub projects: https://github.com/orgs/vi-eclipse/projects


## Purpose

The backlogs serve as a means to transparently show and manage the Eclipse-related efforts at Vector Informatik. They do not represent a separate development stream in addition to the official Eclipse GitHub repositories.
Backlog items reflect issues already published in the official Eclipse GitHub repositories or will, at the latest, also be reflected there when addressing that issue in terms of developing a new feature or analyzing and fixing a bug.
